# Contributing Guidelines

I love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and
transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

<!--=========================================================================-->

## How to contribute
The easiest method to contribute to this project is by providing feedback,
requesting a feature or reporting a bug.  Prior to opening an issue, check the
existing ones, as there might be one that already covers your points.  When
you need to open a new one, provide as much information as you can, especially
for bug reports.

<!--=========================================================================-->

## Reporting bugs
Before raising any bugs, kindly check if a bug is already [opened][opened-issues]
Report a bug by [opening a new issue][new-issue].

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can so anyone can reproduce the issue with basic setup.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

<!--=========================================================================-->

## Request/Propose a new feature
Request/propose a new feature by [opening a new issue][new-feature].

- Provide a feature request summary
- Briefly explain why do you think this feature is necessary and it will help everyone.

<!--=========================================================================-->

## Pull Requests

Do you feel like contributing code?  Awesome! Find an open issue you want to
tackle (can be one of your own), then open a pull request following [these
guidelines][pr-guidelines].  Make sure to **test your changes thoroughly**

<!--=========================================================================-->

### Coding Style

In case you are planning to submit a pull request, please keep your changes
minimal and maintain a clear coding style.  Name your functions and variables
sensibly, comment non-obvious lines of code and match the formatting style of
the rest of the code (indentation, line width, spacing, etc.).

You can use [Vint][vint] and run `vint .` in the repository root to check the
code against the above style guide.

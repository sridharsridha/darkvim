# Contributing Guidelines
I love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and
transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## How to contribute
The easiest method to contribute to this project is by providing feedback,
requesting a feature or reporting a bug.  Prior to opening an issue, check the
existing ones, as there might be one that already covers your points.  When
you need to open a new one, provide as much information as you can, especially
for bug reports.

## Reporting bugs
Before raising any bugs, kindly check if a bug is already [opened](https://github.com/sridharsridha/darkvim/issues)
Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/sridharsridha/darkvim/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can so anyone can reproduce the issue with basic setup.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Request/Propose a new feature
Request/propose a new feature by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/sridharsridha/darkvim/issues/new?template=feature_request.md).

- Provide a feature request summary
- Briefly explain why do you think this feature is necessary and it will help everyone.
